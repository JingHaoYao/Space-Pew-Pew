Space pew pew is a project that I have been working on in Unity for around 3 months. It's my first game that I've ever created and decided to share my progress with those online. All scripts were programmed in C# using Visual Studio as the IDE. Any feedback is appreciated!

Special thanks to Tony I, Victor W, Esther J, and Annie Z for being partners in the game jam which initiated this project.
